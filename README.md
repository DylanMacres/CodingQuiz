This week's challenge was to create a quiz from scratch that had a timer and can determine correct and incorrect responses.
I was successful in creating the quiz with answers and a working timer, however was not successful in creating a leaderboard or a end to the game.
Here are some of the critera we were given:
    GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score
